# 🚨 SatyaDrishti – Emergency-Aware Intelligent Search System

**Weekend of Code 9.0**  
**Problem Statement ID:** M01  
**Team Name:** Neural Nexus  

---

## 📌 Overview

**SatyaDrishti** is an adaptive intelligent search system designed to **detect emergency situations in real time** and dynamically switch its ranking strategy to prioritize **fresh, trustworthy, and actionable information**.

During emergencies, conventional search engines often amplify outdated or viral misinformation due to popularity-based ranking. SatyaDrishti addresses this challenge by introducing an **Emergency Mode** that elevates verified sources and suppresses unreliable content.

Inspired by the mythological concept of an all-seeing vision, SatyaDrishti aims to deliver **calm, accurate, and life-saving information when it matters most**.
